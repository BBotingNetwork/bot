# What is Harbor
Written in GoLang, Harbor is a tool that allows you to turn your Docker Container based server into a powerful virtual machine with root privileges. The goal is to provide a tool that will run on as many hosting services as possible, mostly hosts utilizing Pterodactyl Panel, with as little of a footprint as possible.

&nbsp;

# Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Any hosting provider that utilizes Docker containers.
* The hosting provider must allow running unverified applications.


### Installation
* Download the latest Harbor executable file from GitHub releases.
* Make it an executable by running `chmod +x Harbor`.
* Upload it to the hosting service replacing the original file that is used to run the server, in the case that the hosting service does not support executables, you can download a third-party wrapper from elsewhere.


### Help
If you face any errors or issue while using Harbor, feel free to create an issue on our GitHub repository.
